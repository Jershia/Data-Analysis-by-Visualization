# Data-Analysis
  * *We learned about analysing data through visualization.*
  * *We saw the data of the 12 students of grade 3 who played on pixel math app*
  
### Steps To analysis data using Visualization
  * *We imported pandas and csv and graph_objects from plotly*
  * *We read the data from the csv file and stored it in df variable.*
  * *By using **groupby()** method,we got the mean of the attempts by grouping them by the level.*
  * *Then we plotted the horizontal bar graph based on the data by using orientation as **'h'**.*
  * *We have done this to obtain the total score of all students.*
  * *Now we are going to write code to obtain the score of a particular student.*
  * *We created new file ,imported **pandas,csv and graph_objects from plotly** and read the data from csv and stored it in the df variable.*
  * *We filtered and got the data of the particular student.*
  * *We got the mean of the attempts by grouping them by level and using graph_objects we plotted the bar chart for that student.*
